              It isn’t easy to express the significance of love in our life. God
              has made each living being with no discrimination. Even though we
              as a whole have various behaviors, just the intensity of love can
              hold us together. Love can change over a dangerous personality
              into a valuable one adequately. The man leads towards cruelty
              without the presence of Love. The society treats him with
              inferiority and disrespect. Individuals don’t like to talk with
              him and get in touch with him when they have some urgent work.
              Everything is possible with the assistance of love; that is why
              the creatures understand the unique language of affection. As per
              a famous proverb, “The love can change over a demon to a human.”
              The love is sufficient alone to open all the anxiety of feelings
              and make us take a look at the world from the other’s point of
              view. Love is heavenly, and its capacity can bless us all.
